As shown in the visualization \"Total Number of Products\", the category of the variable repeat purchases has the most observations is 1 with 906 observations.\n\nB. The observations are not balanced across categories of the variable repeat purchases since the number of repeat (category 1), which is 906, is much greater than the number of not repeat (category 0), which is 594.","metadata":{},"id":"1d5ba38c-1b3a-4f9b-bf38-bb0a62dac346","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Task 3","metadata":{},"id":"ce5f6df2-fbf2-4c44-9209-9ee668876b53","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![Visual_Task3](Visual_Task3.png)\n\nThe histogram \"Sales Distribution\" displays the distribution of all of the sales.\n\nThe distribution is not normal.
